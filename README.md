# PDFNoBs - a free PDF file merger for MAC
No one should ever pay for a PDF merger!

I made this out of sheer disbelief that there is no Simple, free PDF merging tool for Macs. Heck, this was 30 minutes of work, the tools already exist, this is just a "fancy" UI around a free MIT package.

Windows has PDF24 and now Macs have PDFNoBs.

No ads, no payment, and all open source.

Just merge your PDFs and go on with your day.

Please feel free to add issues and suggestions and keep in mind, this is my first project.

For all you nontechies, here is the download link for the app:
